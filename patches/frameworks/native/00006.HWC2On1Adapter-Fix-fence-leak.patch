Subject: [PATCH] HWC2On1Adapter: Fix fence leak

* GL blobs hit this leak, that ultimately results in surfaceflinger to crash and SystemUI soft-resetting every so often when under any form of stressful loads.
* Removes the fence dump from Layer::dump, since:
  a) It was leaking (a dup() without a close())
  b) It's not that useful anyway since it wasn't displaying the actual fence fd
